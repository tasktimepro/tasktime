# App Status

## Current focus

- [ ] Complete the direct browser-to-Google Drive sync phase: the private Worker token/policy/auth-hardening and Slice 3 memory-only credential foundation are complete; isolated staging passes OAuth/recovery/data checks, request-budget checks, direct mutation/recovery, and bidirectional proxy/direct file interchange; and Slice 4 is locally implemented through explicit direct/proxy connection selection, direct reads/writes, stable create IDs and reconciliation, sanitized reason-aware retries, next-connection rollback, connection/sync Web Locks, and offline lazy-document request suppression. The production Worker is active with direct rollout locked at `0%`, preserving the proxy for every current client; public health and fail-closed auth/CORS checks pass. Remaining work is the proxy-default PWA release with old-client verification, authenticated staging-browser multipart coverage beyond Chromium, the complete dual-transport/recovery/request-count matrix, and release reconciliation before any direct cohort.
- [x] Complete all six invoice-cancellation slices: terminal retained records, replay-safe source release, Canceled UI/PDF safety, zero-contribution financial reporting, agent parity, and backup `1.5` compatibility.
- [x] Expose the existing paid-invoice correction in the browser three-dot menu with explicit confirmation, paid-only eligibility, refund-safe wording, payment-detail clearing, preserved billing-source claims, and Outstanding/Overdue routing.
- [x] Complete pre-ship hardening for cancellation commit races, persisted-plan field constraints, late-arriving owned claims, protected later billing, and theme-aware canceled-state UI tokens.
- [x] Release the completed cancellation scope locally as `v1.2.0`: core app `1.2.0`, backup contract `1.5`, agent bridge/MCP and OpenClaw/Claude bundles `0.3.0`, ClawHub skill `1.1.0`, and Claude marketplace `1.1.0`; no private Worker change is required, and remote publication or deployment remains pending separate authorization.
- [x] Cross-validate critical persistence and billing specifications against implementation and historical fixtures.
- [x] Complete the dependency-ordered remediation and release checklist in `status/critical-path-assurance.md`.
- [ ] Continue gradual TypeScript migration without breaking stable imports or persisted contracts.
- [x] Establish a zero-diagnostic repository-wide TypeScript baseline and enforce it in the release gate.
- [ ] Improve testing infrastructure while preserving the per-file coverage gate for hooks and utilities.
- [x] Centralize timer lifecycle/recovery, manual time-entry protection, recurring task state, and relationship-bearing work-entity writes across UI and agent surfaces.
- [x] Fail closed on duplicate entity creates, protect billed/tax-claimed expense deletion, and commit paid cross-currency expense mutations only after snapshot preparation.
- [x] Align individual dashboard time-entry and Hours-report total/billable durations with the seconds-aware task display so sub-minute work never appears as `0m`.

## Production baseline

- [x] Yjs multi-document storage and IndexedDB persistence
- [x] Manual, backup, and bidirectional Drive sync modes
- [x] Projects, clients, tasks/subtasks, timers, time entries, planner, goals, and notes
- [x] Expenses, recurrences, tax periods, invoices, quotes, payments, reports, and export/import
- [x] Responsive PWA shell, offline indicator, service worker, and mobile navigation

The July 2026 critical-path assurance phase supplies deeper edge-case, historical-compatibility, failure-injection, browser, PWA, and live-agent evidence for this baseline.
